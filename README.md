## About the Project
In this project I made a TodoApp as instructed in the assignment, with proper frontend, state management and redux storage. I also did the bonus tasks of persistent data storage using firebase to store the data even when the page is refreshed and the ability to mark the tasks as complete without deleting it.

## Installation Directions
First clone the repository, then run the following commands in your terminal
```bash
npm i
```
followed by
```bash
npm run dev
```
then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
